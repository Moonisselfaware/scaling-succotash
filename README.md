I am currently working on my 1st Website utalizing HTML+CSS+Javascript. 
Top goal for the present is focusing on Developing AI with an understanding of the behavriol aspects, 
of how AI grows with injected programms codes from knowledgable databases, while keeping human-in-the-loop at all times. 
The Future is now ready for Devlopment and coding, with an inclusive community thats focused on the same longevity goals. 
1st priority for myself as a begginer is to learn everything and anything about Python and Javascript with the understanding that knowledge of other languages will come as I grow.
I've always found reading Ccode and Developing Software absloutly facinated.
I'm an out the box thinker so my concepts will be differnt my projects will peak intrest but help, 
help is and will always be wanted and needed from myself.
Advice, suggestions, comments are very much encourged and welcomed.
Until my next Project as the 1st coded sytax states "Hello World" 
The Moon is not that far away.
